# React Foundation Boilerplate Project

Basic boilerplate React project with Foundation and Sass

To get started:
* Clone the repo down
* `npm install` the dependencies
* This app uses Webpack for module dependencies. Run `webpack -w` to have webpack running. You may need to install `webpack` globally.
* Finally, `npm start` to launch the app on `localhost:3000`
